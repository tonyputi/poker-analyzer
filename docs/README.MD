#Poker hands

The file hands.txt, contains 1000 random hands dealt to two players.
Each line of the file contains ten cards (space separated). the
first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can
assume that all hands are valid, each player's hand is in no specific order and
in each hand there is a clear winner.

Build a PHP MVC solution that has the following Functionality:

1. Upload the file
2. Parse file into a DB
3. have a way to show how many hands player 1 wins
4. Authentication

Please upload the completed solution with a README.md of how to get everything
up and running to github.

I have attached a sheet with the poker rules if you require them. If you need
anything feel free to drop me an email joe@griffin.pm.
